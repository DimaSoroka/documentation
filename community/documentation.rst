Writing Documentation
=====================

Open source project is easy to work with as all execution flows can be analyzed and profiled with a relation to
actual implementation. Code shows implementation but not always explains high level vision and possible use cases,
architecture. We strongly believe into importance of documentation and power of community, please help us
to open Oro Platform insights in clear and easy form.


Documentation Format
--------------------

The Oro Platform documentation uses `reStructuredText`_ markup language and `Sphinx`_ generator for web publishing.
Please find more information about syntax on Sphinx website by reading `reStructuredText Primer`_.
