Once Upon a Time...
-------------------

... there lived a man Jack, who owned a nice toy-factory that he called *John&Sons*. When his three sons grew up, the 
eldest stayed in the city running the factory and outlets in the city. The second brother opened "John&Sons" shop in LA. 
The youngest brother decided to run an on-line "John&Sons* store, and developed his own website.
As on-line sales appeared a success but the other two brothers could not run own websites, they decided to use a 
proven e-Commerce software and launched *John&Sons* and *John&Sons LA* shops at Magento. Being rather well-off, the
brothers stayed active members of the community and they started a *John&Sons* charity-fund to help children in need.

Brothers' business seemed to go well, but there was one thing that bothered them:
The boys have literally grown up behind the counter and knew that the next thing after great quality of goods is 
attention and care you show to your customers. Their father always remembered all of the customers' names and birthdays, 
greeted them and gave discounts to the regular ones. It was much easier back then, though. Today the brother definitely 
wanted to make sure that any *John&Sons*' customer is warmly welcomed in any of their shops and outlets, charity 
activity appreciated and, of course, that birthday greetings go to their addresses.

Fairy-tales, though far from true, teach good lads a thing or two, they say. So however fictional John and his sons are,
the problems they have faced are very topical for many businesses today. The era of E-commerce with all of its awesome 
opportunities has brought a number of challenges on the way to the marketing Olympus, including rapidly growing 
customer-bases, customer's demand for faster and more client-oriented service and, the last but far not least, a need to
manage several on-line and off-line shops with numerous partner-programs, additional license and service sales, and so 
on and so forth.

That is when :term:`OroCRM` steps on-stage. Its analysis and reporting tools provide for extensive customer profiling 
and drill-down marketing capabilities. Its natural flexibility and scalability help to meet the aim of your specific 
business and it gives answers to the challenges of modern market, including multiple sales&customer sources.

So the brothers have started a *John&Sons* company at OroCRM. Let's see what problems this has helped to overcome:

The first big aim was to monitor information on customers of different shops and on participants of the charity project
and make sure any brother can see activity of a specific person, family or company across them. The answer to that is 
:ref:`Multichannel functionality <user-guide-channel-guide>` with which you can create a separate Channel for each of
the customer sources (whether your "customers" are visitors of a shop in LA, big businesses that want to make a contract
with you, on-line shop clients or community members who have taken part in the charity) and than aggregate information 
of chosen set of customers (regardless the channel) into one record in the system (called *Account*).

At the start the brothers only worried about most basic details and actions of their customers, but it appeared that 
with OroCRM that could also monitor their potential off-line sales (:ref:`Leads <user-guide-system-entities-leads>` and 
:ref:`opportunities <user-guide-system-entities-opportunities>`), their Magento sales 
(:ref:`Carts and Orders <user-guide-magento-management`), as well specify the rules and settings for groups of other 
records and details of their customers (:ref:`Entities <user-guide-entity-management>`).

They often met to exchange experience and work-out the most efficient procedures and  with the :ref:`Workflows 
functionality <user-guide-workflow-management>` it was easy to make sure the employees follow them.
Of course no one wanted to show all the customer details to every sales assistant, so with the OroCMR 
:ref:`User Management functionality <user-guide-user-management> the brothers defined such rules that their employees  
OroCRM could access to many different details, but only to those that were relevant for them (e.g. a marketing 
department saw the campaigns, sales managers of certain area saw only the customers in their area and heads of 
departments in a state saw details of all the areas in the state).

At the same time the brother could enjoy the whole picture and :ref:`Report<user-guide-reports>` helped to assess the
performance and see any trends, taking correct actions and making right decisions.

Oh! An of course, with the OroCRM's :ref:`Email functionality <user-guide-emails>` their on-line customers always got 
greeting cards and the :ref:`Actions <user-guide-actions>` were there to remind of a birthday call to off-line 
stakeholders, as well as of any other things there were to remember (tasks, Emails, important events, etc.)

OroCRM is of course not a fairy godmother but it definitely can make management of customer relations simple and 
efficient.
